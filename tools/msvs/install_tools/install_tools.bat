echo Tools for Node.js Native Modules Installation Script
echo ====================================================
echo.
echo This Boxstarter script will install Python and the Visual Studio Build Tools,
echo necessary to compile Node.js native modules. Note that Boxstarter,
echo Chocolatey and required Windows updates will also be installed.
echo.
echo This will require about 3 Gb of free disk space, plus any space necessary to
echo install Windows updates.
echo.
echo This will take a while to run. Your computer may reboot during the
echo installation, and will resume automatically.
echo.
echo Please close all open programs for the duration of the installation.
echo.
echo You can close this window to stop now. This script can be invoked from the
echo Start menu. Detailed instructions to install these tools manually are
echo available at https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows

echo !!!!!WARNING!!!!!
echo -----------------
echo This script should make installing the tools as easy as possible. Hence, it
echo WILL NOT OFFER ANY CUSTOMIZATION. If there's any parameter you'd like to
echo customize (like installation directory or features), or if there's any
echo special rule or policy that your computer should comply to (like not being
echo able to log in as the user with administrative privileges), please follow the
echo instructions to download and execute the installers directly:
echo https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows
echo.
echo Use of Boxstarter may reboot your computer automatically multiple times.
echo When performing a reboot, Boxstarter will need to disable User Account
echo Control (UAC) to allow the script to run immediately after the reboot. When
echo the scripts have completed, Boxstarter will re-enable UAC. If you prematurely
echo stop the process, UAC will need to be re-enabled manually.
echo.
echo Sometimes the scripts may install all necessary Windows Updates which
echo could cause a high number of reboots that appear to be a reboot loop when
echo in fact it is just a normal Windows Updates reboot cycle.
